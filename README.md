## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Mount

### Description
It was the part that goes on top of the base.

### Reflection

It wasn't to hard to follow along with Dr. Sheilds doing this part but it taught me that you can just create a new part by extruding off another.


## Fork

### Description
This is the part of the caster that holds the axle and the wheel.

This was a little more difficult than the base and mount but I went to the video of Dr sheilds when i needed help and it was not too hard. It tought me how to fillet and how to do that like curved door shape on the top of a rectangle.


## Tire

### Description
The tire is the part that goes on the outside of the wheel.

This one was actually really simple but it was awesome to learn about the revolve feature that was completly new to me and it was cool to figure.

## Wheel

### Description
Wheel was the part inside the tire the rotating part.

### Reflection

The wheel was good practice with the revolve feature and it showed how you can take the demension and drag it down to see the diameter of the final product.


## AxleCollarBearings

### Description
These parts are the parts that bring the entire thing together.

These parts were farirly easy but they were good to know how to do.
